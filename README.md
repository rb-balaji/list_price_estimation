# Manufacturer List Price Estimation and Prediction Model

## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for the Manufacturer List Price Estimation and Prediction Model. This project aims to estimate manufacturer list prices for products not in our database and predict list price changes based on e-commerce data.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- **Current Objective**: Estimate missing manufacturer list prices using a trained model on existing data.
- **Future Objective**: Predict list price changes based on historical e-commerce data.

### Data Sources
We scrape data from various retail sites, including:
- CVS
- Walgreens
- Walmart
- Amazon
- Costco
- Sam's Club
- Pick N Save

### Metrics Collected
For each product, we collect:
- Retail Price
- Promoted Price
- Product Size
- Manufacturer
- Category
- Retail Site

## Model Development

### Key Features
Identifying important features is crucial for the model's accuracy. The features used in our model include:
- Retail Price
- Promoted Price
- Product Size
- Manufacturer
- Category
- Retail Site

### Data Preprocessing
To ensure the model performs well, we preprocess the data by:
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing or normalizing features
- Encoding categorical variables

### Model Selection
We considered several models, including:
- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
- **Tree-based Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for better performance

## Implementation

### Code Snippets

#### Data Loading
```python
import pandas as pd

def load_data(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

#### Data Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Handling missing 'Count' values
    data['Count'] = data['Count'].apply(lambda x: 0 if pd.isnull(x) or x % 1 != 0 else x)
    return data
```

#### Model Training and Prediction
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

def train_model(train_data):
    features = ['Retail_Price', 'Promo_Price', 'Count', 'Manufacturer', 'Category']
    X = pd.get_dummies(train_data[features])
    y = train_data['List_Price']
    
    model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    joblib.dump(model, 'random_forest_model.joblib')
    return model

def predict_list_price(model, predict_data):
    features = ['Retail_Price', 'Promo_Price', 'Count', 'Manufacturer', 'Category']
    X = pd.get_dummies(predict_data[features])
    
    predictions = model.predict(X)
    predict_data['Predicted_List_Price'] = predictions
    predict_data.to_csv('predicted_data.csv', index=False)
```

### Model Accuracy
We achieved the following accuracy metrics on our training data:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.92**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3.30**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.82**
- **R-squared (R2): 0.96**

These metrics indicate a highly accurate model, with an R-squared value of 0.96 meaning that 96% of the variance in list prices is explained by the model. The MAE and RMSE values are low, suggesting that the model's predictions are close to the actual values.

### Understanding the Metrics
- **MAE**: On average, our predictions are off by 0.92 units from the actual list prices.
- **MSE**: This metric gives more weight to larger errors, which helps identify any significant discrepancies in the predictions.
- **RMSE**: Similar to MSE, but in the same units as the target variable, providing an average error magnitude.
- **R2**: Indicates that 96% of the variability in list prices is accounted for by our model, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

## Future Work
- **Data Collection**: Continuously collect more data to improve the model.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- **Prediction of Price Changes**: Develop a model to predict list price changes based on historical trends and external factors.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a successful approach to estimating and predicting manufacturer list prices using machine learning. The high accuracy metrics achieved underscore the effectiveness of the models and preprocessing techniques employed.
